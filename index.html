          <p>The homebuying process is complicated and intimidating to potential buyers. Many potential buyers face the
            challenge of a lack of knowledge of the most important things they need to know about home loans. How might
            we simplify the process and show qualified and motivated candidates how simple and easy buying a home can
            be?</p>
          <P>The solution is the SafeHaven app. Users trust Safehaven becuase they know they can get in touch with a
            local agent anytime at their convience. They can self-educate themselves and are reassured about getting the
            best value before they apply
            for a loan. </P>
